Header file  Debug Trace.
Description:- Component to print the debug information in serial in parallel.
                1. If Enabled This Component shall buffer the debug information and print via Serial in back ground.
                2. If Enable shall support to get the all latest debug info in to a single or separate buffer, Can use to print in HTML.
Limitation:- 1. Tested for Esp 32, May required more RAM memory for buffer all debug Info..
             2. Buffer sizes needs to be consider based on what frequency did the debug Info get keep on request. 
                 Because if enough buffer not allocated, then can Ignore old debug info to handle new request.
